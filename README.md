# Object-based augmentation for remote sensing images segmentation via CNN

We proposea  high-throughput  workflow  tool-chain  for  georeferenced  imageaugmentation  that  enables  a  significant  increase  in  the  amountof  training  samples.  The  presented  pipeline  exploits  objectsâ€™segmentation  masks  to  produce  new  realistic  training  scenesfrom target objects and various label-free backgrounds.

The augmnetation scheme and generated samples are presented below. Both target objects and backgrounds are from different images.

Ground truth, RGB image (a), models prediction without augmentation (b) and with object-based augmnetation (c) are shown below.
